## Features to add

Certain types of repeated data will trip up the formater, this needs to be corrected. 
### Currently data can not be changed once entered
This is a very usuful feature to add!!
### Correct some small issues with the NAME attribute
The NAME attribute exists but needs to be editable by the user, in its current state it is not.
